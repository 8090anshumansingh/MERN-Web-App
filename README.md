# How I Built My First MERN App in a Week

This repository contains the code for a web application I created using the MERN tech stack.

I wrote an article that talks about the resources I used, problems I faced, and criticisms [here](https://google.com).

If you want to play around with a deployed version of this web app, I have it hosted on Heroku [here](https://martinb-inventory.herokuapp.com/)
